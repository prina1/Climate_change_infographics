            <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
            <p>Climate change refers to the long-term alteration of Earth's average weather patterns and global temperatures. It is primarily driven by the increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, creating a "greenhouse effect" that leads to a warming of the planet.</p>

        <div class="section causes">
            <h2>Causes of Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial processes, and agriculture are among the main factors contributing to climate change. These activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and leading to global warming.</p>

        <div class="section effects">
            <h2>Effects of Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change has wide-ranging effects, including rising temperatures, sea level rise, extreme weather events, impact on ecosystems, health risks, agricultural challenges, and more. These effects highlight the urgency of addressing climate change through mitigation and adaptation strategies.</p>
